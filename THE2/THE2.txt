In this take-home exam, you are going to implement a citizenship inquiry system. 
States grant citizenship through various mechanisms (e.g., birth, marriage and 
naturalization) with varying details. Your system will be only based on the applicantâ€™s
birth conditions. Write a Python program for only two countries, "USA" and "Switzerland",
in which an applicant will answer a set of "yes"/"no" questions to find out if they are 
granted citizenship or not.

Sample Run:
Please enter the country for citizenship inquiry: Switzerland
Are the applicant's parents married? no
Is unmarried mother a Swiss citizen? no
Is unmarried father a Swiss citizen? yes
Does unmarried father acknowledge paternity? yes
The applicant is a Swiss citizen.
