In this take-home exam, your task is to conduct a series of statistical analyses on a database
containing historical records of book sales. The input will be a string of a predetermined format, 
containing the book's title, author, publication year, and it's all-time sales number separated by
commas (,). Each book entry is delimited by dollar signs ($).

book_title1,author1,publication_year1,sales1$book_title2,author2,publication_year2,sales2$...

Once you get the string, you will first perform two input checks.

	a) Each book entry must consist of 4 elements (title, author, year, sales).
	b) The database must not have duplicated items (based on book titles).

If the provided string meets the specified input criteria, you will prompt the user with
a menu asking for a statistical operation.

1) Display an author's average book sales (there might be multiple record for a particular author)
	2) Display the book with the highest sales 
	3) Display the year that saw the greatest number of books published (not the total number of sales,
     we focus on the number of distinct books). 

Afterward, you'll receive the user's input for their choice and execute the corresponding operation.
