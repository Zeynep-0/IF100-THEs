In this assignment, you are going to calculate the transmission delay of sending an 
image over two communication channels with different bandwidths. The first communication
channel is an old modem with 64 kilobits per second (Kbps), and the second is an ethernet 
connection with 10 Megabits per second (Mbps). Once you determine the total number of bits 
to be transmitted, you need to calculate the time to send the image over both channels and 
print them in the appropriate format.

Sample Run:
Please enter the image width in pixels: 1280
Please enter the image height in pixels: 720

Tranmission delay of an 1280x720 image - (22118400 bits in total)
Over 64 Kbps modem connection: 0 hour(s), 5 minute(s) and 45.6000 second(s)
Over 10 Mbps ethernet connection: 0 hour(s), 0 minute(s) and 2.2118 second(s)
