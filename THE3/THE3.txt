For this take-home exam, you will write a Python program that will simulate
a simple version of an authentication process, by taking the following four (4) 
information as inputs and working on them: 
●	Usernames, together with corresponding scrambled passwords of users, in a predetermined format
●	Last modification date of the password until now, in a predetermined format
●	Username
●	Password

By using the username and password given by the user (third and fourth inputs), 
your program should check if the user's credentials match the credentials given before (first input). 

Sample Run:
Please enter usernames and passwords: coff33c4ke:cr0t4id@lgoff33c4ke;j0mesb0nd7:jredips?etaraK0mesb0nd7;hubblebubble:h.sneil@_etucubblebubble
Please enter last modification information: 0year(s) 10month(s);2year(s) 5month(s);0year(s) 5month(s)
